# I source my environment in ~/.zshenv because ~/.zshenv is executed for login
# and non-login shells. However, kali linux overwrites my PATH in /etc/zprofile
# which is sourced after ~/.zshenv. This results in tmux not picking up my
# correct PATH. That's why I source my environment again in ~/.zprofile and
# remove duplicates in PATH
# TODO: make this platform dependent for kali linux

# Source my shell independent enviroment variables
source ~/.environment

# remove duplicates in paths
