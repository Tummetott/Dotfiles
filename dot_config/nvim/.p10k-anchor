This specific file functions as an anchor for Powerlevel10k. When you navigate
(cd) into the directory containing this file, Powerlevel10k will truncate the
directory path displayed in your prompt, shortening it to just this directory.
This means only the path of this directory and its subdirectories, if any, will
be shown in the prompt, effectively hiding the rest of the path leading up to
it.
