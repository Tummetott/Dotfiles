# This script enhances the re-execution mechanism of Chezmoi installation
# scripts. Commonly, Chezmoi uses the 'onchange_' prefix in script names and
# incorporates external data, like hashes, via templates to trigger
# re-executions. When this external data changes, the script is marked for
# re-run.

# The first piece of external data is the hash of the
# ~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml file. Directly hashing a target file within a
# Chezmoi template requires an absolute path, affecting portability. To
# circumvent this, we calculate and store the hash of chezmoi.toml in the source
# space. This approach retains portability and allows Chezmoi templates to use
# the 'include' directive, enabling the script to detect changes and re-execute
# as necessary.

# The second piece of external data is provided by the installer script itself.
# Initially, repeat.hash is empty, serving as a placeholder. It gets updated
# with the hash of the current time when the installer script determines a
# re-execution is necessary after the system reboots. This mechanism acts as a
# trigger, indicating that another run of the script is required to complete or
# update the installation process post-reboot.
