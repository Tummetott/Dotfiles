# Important: Do not export ZDOTDIR for cross-OS compatibility. Linux starts with
# a login shell, then switches to interactive, non-login shells. MacOS does not
# start with a login shell, but treats all shells as interactive login shells.
# Exporting ZDOTDIR would lead to inconsistencies: On Linux, ~/.zshenv is
# overlooked for interactive shells as Zsh searches ~/.config/zsh/.zshenv.
# However, macOS sources it as expected.
